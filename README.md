Java Digital Clock
This is a simple digital clock program written in Java using Swing. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates the display every second.

Getting Started
To use this program, you need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from the official Java website.

To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the DigitalClockGUI.java file is located, and type the following command:

java DigitalClockGUI
This will compile and run the program. You should see a window with a digital clock that displays the current time.

Customizing the Clock
You can customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the code in the DigitalClockGUI.java file. You can change the font, font size, foreground color, background color, and layout of the clock by modifying the appropriate lines of code.
